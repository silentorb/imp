Welcome to the Underworld!  Imp is an object-oriented programming language that compiles to other object-oriented programming languages.  Imp is short for:

* Imperative
* Implementation
* sImple	
* Some other word I can't remember
* Imps

"simple is simplified simplified, and imp is simplified simple"

Imp is a humble language, which means:

* Imp exists to serve its target languages (and the Overlord), not the other way around.
* Imp is not designed to be a monolithic language for programmers who only know Imp. It is designed for programmers who juggle multiple languages and need a tool to bridge the gap.
* Imp is not fancy or revolutionary.

At the time of this writing Imp has limited support for C++, C#, and JavaScript.  Improved support and additional languages will hopefully come with time.
	
Under the hood, Imp is a world populated by dungeons, portals, and minions.  On the surface it looks like any other language.  This is because:

1. One of imp's goals is to be a middle-man between common languages, which means having a common vocabulary.
2. Imp is intended to make programs that contain dungeons, portals, and minions, so what fun would it be if those were reserved words?
	
Imp originated as a lower-level counterpart to the MetaHub programming language.  MetaHub is built ontop of Imp and generates Imp code structures.  
If you use C#, Imp has a useful API for generating and transforming Imp code structures.  It also sports some nifty templating features.

Imp is written in C# though may someday bootstrap itself.
